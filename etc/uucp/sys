# sys		This is the file where you define all the remote
#		UUCP systems you know about, whether you dial in to them
#		or they dial in to you.
#
#		Note that if you want to dial into another system, you
#		have to enter the loginname and password NOT here but
#		in the file /etc/uucp/call.
#

#
# First some defaults. These are for all other entries (unless overridden).

# This is an alternate - it means that if a connection using the
# above "system alphen" fails it falls through to this entry. Only
# useful if your service provider has more then one phone number for UUCP.

#
# Here's another alternate - we poll the system over TCP/IP. This is
# useful if we have a PPP connection to our provider. The first two entries
# will fail because the modem is busy and we will poll over TCP/IP.
