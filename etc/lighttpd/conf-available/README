ligghttpd Configuration under Debian GNU/Linux
==============================================

Files and Directories in /etc/lighttpd:
---------------------------------------

lighttpd.conf:
	 main configuration file

conf-available/
	This directory contains a series of .conf files. These files contain
        configuration directives necessary to load and run webserver modules.
	If you want to create your own files they names should be
        build as nn-name.conf where "nn" is two digit number (number
	is used to find order for loading files)

conf-enabled/	  
	To actually enable a module for lighttpd, it is necessary to create a 
        symlink in this directory to the .conf file in conf-available/.

Enabling and disabling modules could be done by provided
/usr/sbin/lighty-enable-mod and /usr/sbin/lighty-disable-mod scripts.
